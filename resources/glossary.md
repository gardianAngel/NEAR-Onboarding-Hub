# Glossary

## A

**Account ID**
: The unique identifier for a NEAR account (e.g., `alice.testnet`, `bob.near`)

**AssemblyScript**
: A TypeScript-like language that compiles to WebAssembly, used for NEAR smart contracts

## B

**Balance**
: The amount of NEAR tokens in an account, measured in yoctoNEAR (10^-24 NEAR)

**Blockchain**
: A distributed ledger technology that NEAR Protocol is built on

## C

**Call Method**
: A smart contract function that can modify state and costs gas to execute

**Cross-contract Call**
: A smart contract calling functions on another smart contract

## D

**DApp**
: Decentralized Application - a web application that interacts with blockchain smart contracts

**Deploy**
: The process of uploading a smart contract to the NEAR blockchain

## G

**Gas**
: The fee required to execute transactions and smart contract calls on NEAR

**Gas Limit**
: The maximum amount of gas you're willing to spend on a transaction

## M

**Mainnet**
: The main NEAR Protocol network where real transactions occur

**Master Account**
: An account that has permission to create sub-accounts

## N

**NEAR CLI**
: Command-line interface tool for interacting with NEAR Protocol

**NEAR Tokens**
: The native cryptocurrency of the NEAR Protocol

## S

**Smart Contract**
: Self-executing code stored on the blockchain

**Storage Staking**
: NEAR tokens locked to pay for data storage on the blockchain

## T

**Testnet**
: A test network for NEAR Protocol where tokens have no real value

**Transaction**
: An action recorded on the blockchain, such as token transfers or contract calls

## V

**View Method**
: A smart contract function that reads data without modifying state (free to call)

## W

**Wallet**
: Software that stores your NEAR account credentials and allows you to interact with the blockchain

**WebAssembly (WASM)**
: The bytecode format that NEAR smart contracts are compiled to

## Y

**yoctoNEAR**
: The smallest unit of NEAR tokens (10^-24 NEAR)
