## 🚀 Guide 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

### What You'll Learn
Set up everything you need to start building on NEAR Protocol in under 15 minutes.

### Before You Start
- Basic familiarity with command line
- Node.js installed on your computer

### Step 1: Install NEAR CLI
```bash
npm install -g near-cli
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation
```bash
near --version
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Development Network
```bash
near login
```

### Quick Success Check ✅
Run `near state` - if you see network information, you're ready to go!

**Common Issues:** Can't install NEAR CLI? Try using `sudo` on Mac/Linux or run as administrator on Windows.

---

## 🔐 Guide 2: Create Your First NEAR Account

### What You'll Learn
Create and fund a NEAR account for development and testing.

### The 1-2-3 Launch Process

**1. Choose Your Account Name**
- Must be lowercase, letters and numbers only
- Example: `yourname.testnet` (for testnet)

**2. Create the Account**
```bash
near create-account yourname.testnet --masterAccount yourname.testnet
```

**3. Fund Your Account**
- Visit [NEAR Faucet](https://near-faucet.io) for testnet tokens
- Request tokens for your new account

### Success Indicator 🎯
Your account shows a positive balance when you run:
```bash
near state yourname.testnet
```

---

## 📦 Guide 3: Deploy Your First Smart Contract

### What You'll Learn
Deploy a simple "Hello World" smart contract to understand the deployment process.

### The 1-2-3 Launch Process

**1. Create Your Contract**
Create a file called `hello.js`:
```javascript
export function hello() {
  return "Hello, NEAR!";
}
```

**2. Deploy to Network**
```bash
near deploy --wasmFile hello.wasm --accountId yourname.testnet
```

**3. Test Your Contract**
```bash
near call yourname.testnet hello --accountId yourname.testnet
```

### Success Indicator 🎯
You receive the response: `"Hello, NEAR!"`

**Coffee Shop Analogy:** Think of deploying like setting up a coffee shop. You create the menu (contract), open the shop (deploy), and serve your first customer (call the function).

---

## 🔧 Guide 4: Interact with Smart Contracts

### What You'll Learn
Call functions, pass parameters, and handle responses from NEAR smart contracts.

### The 1-2-3 Launch Process

**1. Call View Functions (Free)**
```bash
near view contractname.testnet get_greeting
```

**2. Call Change Functions (Costs Gas)**
```bash
near call contractname.testnet set_greeting '{"message": "Hello World"}' --accountId yourname.testnet
```

**3. Handle Function Results**
```javascript
// In your frontend
const result = await contract.get_greeting();
console.log(result);
```

### Success Indicator 🎯
You can read data from and write data to your contract successfully.

---

## 💰 Guide 5: Handle NEAR Tokens and Payments

### What You'll Learn
Send NEAR tokens, handle payments in smart contracts, and manage transaction fees.

### The 1-2-3 Launch Process

**1. Send NEAR Tokens**
```bash
near send yourname.testnet recipient.testnet 1.5
```

**2. Handle Payments in Contracts**
```javascript
export function purchase_item({ amount }) {
  const deposit = near.attachedDeposit();
  assert(deposit >= amount, "Insufficient payment");
  // Process purchase
}
```

**3. Check Transaction Status**
```bash
near tx-status TRANSACTION_HASH --accountId yourname.testnet
```

### Success Indicator 🎯
You can successfully send tokens and your contract can accept payments.

**Gas Fees Explained Using Coffee Shop Analogies:** Gas fees are like tips at a coffee shop - they pay the network (baristas) for processing your transaction (making your coffee).

---

## 🌐 Guide 6: Build a Simple DApp Frontend

### What You'll Learn
Create a web interface that connects to your NEAR smart contract.

### The 1-2-3 Launch Process

**1. Set Up Your Project**
```bash
npx create-near-app my-dapp
cd my-dapp
```

**2. Connect to Your Contract**
```javascript
import { connect, Contract } from 'near-api-js';

const contract = new Contract(account, 'contractname.testnet', {
  viewMethods: ['get_greeting'],
  changeMethods: ['set_greeting']
});
```

**3. Build Your Interface**
```html
<button onclick="callContract()">Get Greeting</button>
<div id="result"></div>
```

### Success Indicator 🎯
Your web page can display data from your smart contract.

---

## 👤 Guide 7: Implement User Authentication

### What You'll Learn
Add NEAR wallet authentication to your DApp so users can log in.

### The 1-2-3 Launch Process

**1. Initialize Wallet Connection**
```javascript
import { WalletConnection } from 'near-api-js';

const wallet = new WalletConnection(near, 'my-dapp');
```

**2. Add Login/Logout Buttons**
```javascript
// Login
wallet.requestSignIn('contractname.testnet');

// Logout
wallet.signOut();
```

**3. Check User Status**
```javascript
if (wallet.isSignedIn()) {
  const accountId = wallet.getAccountId();
  console.log(`Logged in as ${accountId}`);
}
```

### Success Indicator 🎯
Users can log in with their NEAR wallet and you can identify them.

---

## 🔍 Guide 8: Debug Common Issues

### What You'll Learn
Identify and fix the most common problems developers encounter.

### The 1-2-3 Launch Process

**1. Check Network Status**
```bash
near state yourname.testnet
```

**2. Review Error Messages**
Common errors and solutions:
- `AccountNotFound`: Check account name spelling
- `InsufficientFunds`: Add more tokens to your account
- `FunctionCallError`: Check function name and parameters

**3. Use Debug Tools**
```bash
near tx-status TRANSACTION_HASH --accountId yourname.testnet
```

### Success Indicator 🎯
You can identify why transactions fail and fix common issues.

---

## 🌍 Guide 9: Deploy to NEAR Mainnet

### What You'll Learn
Move your tested application from testnet to mainnet for real users.

### The 1-2-3 Launch Process

**1. Create Mainnet Account**
- Purchase a NEAR account on mainnet
- Fund it with real NEAR tokens

**2. Deploy Your Contract**
```bash
near deploy --wasmFile contract.wasm --accountId yourname.near --networkId mainnet
```

**3. Update Frontend Configuration**
```javascript
const config = {
  networkId: "mainnet",
  nodeUrl: "https://rpc.mainnet.near.org",
  walletUrl: "https://wallet.mainnet.near.org"
};
```

### Success Indicator 🎯
Your DApp works on mainnet with real users and transactions.

---

## ⚡ Guide 10: Optimize for Performance

### What You'll Learn
Make your DApp faster and more efficient to provide better user experience.

### The 1-2-3 Launch Process

**1. Optimize Smart Contract Code**
```javascript
// Bad: Multiple storage reads
export function inefficient_function() {
  const data1 = near.storageRead("key1");
  const data2 = near.storageRead("key2");
  // Process data
}

// Good: Batch operations
export function efficient_function() {
  const batch = near.storageBatchRead(["key1", "key2"]);
  // Process batch
}
```

**2. Minimize Frontend Bundle Size**
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build:analyze

# Remove unused dependencies
npm prune
```

**3. Cache Data Effectively**
```javascript
// Cache view function results
const cached_data = localStorage.getItem('greeting');
if (!cached_data) {
  const data = await contract.get_greeting();
  localStorage.setItem('greeting', data);
}
```

### Success Indicator 🎯
Your DApp loads faster and uses less gas per transaction.
